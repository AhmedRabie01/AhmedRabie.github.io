## Internships

### Industry Ready Project at INeuron 

I worked on end-to-end data science projects for real-world business use cases. In this program, we discussed projects from scratch such as understanding problem statements, capturing requirements, and various aspects of project design using different documentation such as High-Level Design, Low-Level Design, and Architecture Design. Practical use of MLOPS practices using tools such as MLFLOW, and Wandb. Pipeline implementation for training, retraining, and inferencing. Designing a dashboard to present important KPIs to monitor system and model performance and generate an alert to notify the appropriate parties to address serious problems if it is about to occur.

#### Sensor Fault Detection
 
The Air Pressure System (APS) is a critical component of a heavy-duty vehicle that uses compressed air to force a piston to provide pressure to the brake pads, slowing the vehicle down. The benefits of using an APS instead of a hydraulic system are the easy availability and long-term sustainability of natural air.
