### Data Scinece projects 

#### Arabic Sentiment Analysis using Arabic BERT

This project is an End-To-End NLP endeavor focused on sentiment analysis in
Arabic text,utilizing Arabic BERT.

It features automated processes for data handling, validation, transformation,
model training, evaluation, and deployment. Data quality is ensured through
validation and transformation, enhancing model performance.

The sentiment analysis model is deployed via Fast API as an interactive web
app for real-time sentiment analysis.

The entire project, including codebase and documentation, is available on the
creator's GitHub repository, showcasing expertise in NLP, machine learning,
and web development.

#### Stock-Market-Analysis-Prediction

This an End-To-End project, I aim to build a machine learning model that
predicts the stock prices of Microsoft. The data used in this project was
collected from Yahoo Finance.

The project includes data cleaning, visualization, feature engineering, and
model training and evaluation, all automated through a pipeline that
streamlines the workflow. The pipeline uses the deep learning algorithm
LSTM to create the model.

The pipeline in this project provides an efficient and automated approach to
data processing, modeling, and evaluation, and showcases my ability to work
with different tools and techniques to streamline the machine-learning
workflow.
